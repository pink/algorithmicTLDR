							<p><strong>Algorithmic tl;dr</strong> is an Auto Summarization Model adapted from a research paper published through the <a href="http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Publication/61454589/an-algorithm-for-summarization-of-paragraph-up-to-one-third-with-the-help-of-cue-words-comparison">International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications</a> in 2014.</p>

							<p>I came across this paper through Microsoft's Academic Research portal and thought it would be interesting to see how the algorithm performed since it had yet to be implemented for general use.</p>

							<p>The algorithm employs simple Natural Language Processing techniques in order to assign priority to sentences based off common adverbs, nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It additionally attempts to maximize the amount of salient information retained by ignoring stop words and taking note of numbers mentioned. Through a series of computations and comparisons the algorithm ranks the sentences based off these metrics and attempts to return a paragraph of optimal length and clarity.</p>

							<p>In my preliminary testing I found that in general the algorithm reduced paragraphs by roughly 60%, and maintained a sentiment score very close to the original text.</p>

								A new report on child welfare that found more US children living in poverty than before the Great Recession belies the fanfare of the nation's economic turnaround.

Twenty-two percent of American children were living in poverty in 2013 compared with 18 percent in 2008, according to the latest Kids Count Data Book, with poverty rates nearly double among African-Americans and American Indians and problems most severe in South and Southwest.

The report, released Tuesday from the child advocacy group the Annie E Casey Foundation, showed some signs of slight improvement, including high school graduation rates at an all-time high and a falling percentage of uninsured children. But the bright spots weren't enough to offset a picture that many children have been left behind amid the nation's economic recovery.

The problems extend beyond - and in some cases drive - increasing poverty rates. More children were raised in single-parent homes in 2013 than in 2008, and fewer lived with parents with secure employment.

Foundation President Patrick McCarthy said that particularly troubling is an increase in the share of kids living in poor communities, regardless of their own families' economic standing. The report says 1 in 7 children live in those areas, marked by poor schools and a lack of a safe place to play.

"They're more likely to fall down the economic ladder, less likely to be employed and more likely to get in trouble," McCarthy said.
